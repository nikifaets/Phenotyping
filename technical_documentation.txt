Description of files:

- main.py:

module for training the autoencoder and saving the neural network in a file.

- clustering.py:

loads the neural network and feeds test data into it. Then performs clustering on the latents space's output and evaluates the performance.


- create_dataset.py:

reorders the data so that positive samples are in the beginning (both the arrays with labels and images)
reordered arrays are stored as data/cell-type/balanced/...
split = only the cell channel
merged = both channels

These reordered arrays are used for training and testing since they are easier to use.

- extract_data.py:

extracts a single layer from multi-layer data

- bc_to_jpg.py:

converts .npy and .bc files to .jpg (mainly for debugging); applies blur to all images.

- create_labels.py:

makes a binary .npy array where arr[i] = True if the i-th sample in the original .bc files is a positive sample

- autoencoder3D.py:

the Autoencoder class for tuning the network's parameters.

- networks.py:

a bunch of networks for experiments
